Solutions to the assignments for the famouse ML course by Andrew Ng. The solutions are implemented in Python, although the assignments assumed the Octave would be used.

I did the exercises for the purpose of practicing doing some simple machine learning problems.

Each folder contains materials, downloaded directly from the course website, and also the solution, named solx.py, where x is the index of the assignment.
